# Information form for participants
# Hello, and thank you for considering participation in our research project at Eindhoven University of Technology. This study involves an innovative GPT-4 summarization tool, and your involvement would be invaluable, especially given your interest or expertise in this field.
# Participation is entirely voluntary, with no associated physical, legal, or economic risks. You have full freedom to choose which questions to answer and the option to withdraw at any time without any adverse consequences. If you have questions or need more information after reading about the study, please reach out to Sichen Guo.
# üéØ Aim and benefit of the study
# The aim of this research project is to invite the participants to engage with our designed tool, experience real-time interaction, and receive immediate outcomes. We will evaluate the effectiveness of these interactions by measuring both the duration of validated engagement and the overall user experience via questionnaires and interviews.
# This study is performed by Fran√ßois Leborgne and Sichen Guo, all Engineering Doctorate (EngD)  trainees of the Designing Human-System Interaction program, and this study under the supervision of Jun Hu of the Industrial Design Department.
# üßó Procedure
# During this project, we ask you to: 
# 1.	Choose the first letter (health) to upload.
# 2.	Look through the content and choose the content and information you know from this letter. 
# 3.	Put the chosen letter in the newly designed summarized system. 
# 4.	Choose the action points or highlight points you know from this letter. 
# 5.	Fill in a survey with 9 questions. 
# 6.	Choose the second letter (Financial) to upload.
# 7.	Redo the procedure from step 2 to step 5
# 8.	In the end, you will be invited to do a semi-structure interview
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks
# The study does not involve any risks, detrimental side effects, or cause discomfort.
# üïô Duration
# The instructions, measurements and debriefing will take approximately 30 minutes.
# üßë‚Äçüíº Voluntary
# Your participation is completely voluntary. You can refuse to participate without giving any reasons and you can stop your participation at any time during the study. You can also withdraw your permission to use your data immediately after completing the study. None of this will have any negative consequences for you whatsoever.
# üìä Confidentiality and use, storage, and sharing of data
# The collected data will be stored on TU/e supported storage facilities.
# We will make sure that any published research results will not include confidential or identifiable information about you unless you explicitly agree to it, for example, if you want your name to be mentioned in publications.
# Your personal data might be used for future research, but only if your data is truly necessary if the recognized ethical standards for scientific research are followed, and if the new research objectives align with the current research objectives. If your personal data is used in future research, we will take all reasonable steps to inform you about this. You can object to the use of your data for new research.
# We might use anonymized data for new purposes such as research or education. We will ensure the data cannot be linked to you and we will not disclose anything that makes you identifiable. This research has been assessed and approved by the ethical committee of Eindhoven University of Technology.
# The screen and time will be recorded during the interacting process, and the interview script will be recorded by audio recording.
# üì∞ Further information
# If you want more information about this study, the study design, or the results, you can contact Fran√ßois Leborgne (contact email: f.m.g.leborgne@tue.nl ) or Sichen Guo (contact email: s.guo3@tue.nl). If you have any complaints about this study, please contact the supervisor, Jun Hu (j.hu@tue.nl) You can report irregularities related to scientific integrity to confidential advisors of the TU/e.
